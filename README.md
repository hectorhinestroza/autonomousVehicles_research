# autonomousVehicles_research
This is a repo created by Hector. In this repo i posted all the work we have done in Dr.Comert research this spring 2018, keep posting and updating the content.

In this repository you will find:

1.the source code of the basic algorithm I created for line following and color detection specifically for the gray tape in the lab
2. All the resources and contents we have used to install and learn python, OpenCV and all related contents such as the operation of the raspberryPi

Know that if you don't have any of the software installed in your computer it is going to take you some time to get everything up and running. Just follow the tutorials and if you have any questions don't hesitate to contac Hector or Sebastian. 

Coments about the code

The code I created is object_detection.py in the OpenCV tutorials folder the rest of the files are tutorials that you will probably find. feel free to read them, understand them and play with them. Also the code requires the motion.mp4 file to run. When its time feel free to use your own videos.

Please take your time to read and understand the code, you will have to got through the tutorials and the info posted here to get a grasp of what is going on in the code. The code is inside the 1V SDcard so you can test it yourself. the code is messy because i was playing with it as you guys will be doing, nonetheless i have included some comments that will help you understand a little better. The code is currently runing slow as you will realize if you run it on the car so prepare yourself to come up with and idea to make its performance and accuracy improve.  

When you are trying to play with the chore functions of the vehicles (move forward, backward, turn the wheels and the camera) in your own code make sure to import all the modules of the picar and use the designated functions that should be displayed in the codes that are already preloaded in the original repository. 

Wish you the best this summer!
